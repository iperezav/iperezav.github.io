If you are creating this PR in order to submit a draft of your paper, please name your PR with `Paper: <title>`. An editor will then add a `draft` label; this will trigger GitHub Actions to run automated checks on your paper and build a preview. You may then work to resolve failed checks and ensure the preview build looks correct. If you have any questions, please tag the proceedings team in a comment on your PR with `@scipy-conference/2025-proceedings`.

See the [project readme](https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy_proceedings#preview-your-paper) for more information.
